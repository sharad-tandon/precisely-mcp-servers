Returns vegetation proximity and zone coverage data derived from overhead imagery.
Use this tool when you need tree/shrub/vegetation distances, overhang percentages,
or zone-by-zone coverage breakdowns around a building.
Do NOT use if you need building structure or roof data — use get_datalink_geox_property or
get_datalink_geox_roof instead.

Two lookup modes — provide exactly one:
  Mode 1 (by address): provide 'address' only.
  Mode 2 (by ID):      provide 'id' and 'queryType' only. Do NOT also pass 'address'.
